# Javascript-30-Days


Day - 12

Created Key Sequence Detection also known as KONAMI in back days.
It basically detects the key you typed & adds random animations on screen if you type happy on keyboard!!.

1. Played a bit around Splice method in JavaScript.
2. Learned about how can we handle events such as keypress, mouseup.
