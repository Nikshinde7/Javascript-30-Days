Unreal Webcam Fun

For today's exercise we used our webcam, & we dumped the stream on canvas, where we can add various RGB effects to the video & also catch few snapshots as well.

1. Learned about how we can access Video Stream from Webcam.
2. Also, played a bit with screen pixels to create filters.
