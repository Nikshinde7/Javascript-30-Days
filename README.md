# Javascript-30-Days


Day 27/30

Created an feature where if you click and drag the window scrolls

When we see cool animations with different libraries, we do not realise how much toll it takes on the DOM just for those quick, little animations

So today after creating an custom animation with bare css & js. I learned a lot about DOM manipulation, pixel recalculations.

1. Refreshed my understanding with event handlers, by playing with different types of events.
2. Learned about how we need to do different kind of calculations around pixel, just for a small animation.
